Small customer data display/search app written for interview.

To Run:
Either clone to visual studio directly from GitHub, or download the ZIP, extract it and open the VS Solution.
Debug > Start Without Debugging (Ctrl + F5)

The application opens with a grid containing details on all the customers, displayed 3 at a time.
This grid can be sorted Ascending or Descending by any of the fields and there is a list of pages at the bottom, allowing you to move between sets of three customers.

To Search for a specific customer simply type their ID into the text box below the grid and click the Search button.
If you have entered a valid ID the customer data will be returned and displayed in the grid.
